# math-lab
This repo has the aim of implementate useful math tools for academic porposes in Electrical Engineering course.

The dev team has a unique task: bring happiness to electrical engineering students by applying the viewd class tools on computers.

# Objective:
•Avoid boring on hand math problems
\
•Achieve a better comprehension about complex problems
\
•Improve programming skills and study group's workflow

## Current work

Implementate solutions for classical PDE's - Heat, Wave and Laplace's equations

# $k{\nabla{u}} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}$
\
# $a^{2}\nabla^{2}u = \frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial t^{2}}$
\
# $\nabla^{2}u = 0$
